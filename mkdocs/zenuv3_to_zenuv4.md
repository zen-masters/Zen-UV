## Do I need to upgrade from Zen UV 3 to Zen UV 4 in order to retain the product support?

Don't worry, if you are completely satisfied with the functionality of Zen UV 3, you can continue to use it. We do not force users to upgrade and make additional payments.

Support for new versions of Blender and bug fixes for Zen UV 3 will remain. But new features will only be added in Zen UV 4.

## I see the Zen UV 4 product in my library on Gumroad and Blender Market but I can only access the Zen UV 3 files. What is the reason?

Such situation happens, if you purchased Zen UV 3 on Gumroad or Blender Market but you haven’t upgraded it to Zen UV 4 yet. 

The original  Zen UV 3 product on Gumroad and Blender Market became the Zen UV 4 product when the new update was released (with  Zen UV 4 files added as new product variants). The old Zen UV 3 product variants were unpublished but not removed, so that the users who purchased Zen UV 3 still have access to it.

## What Blender version Zen UV 4 will support?

Zen UV 4 supports Blender 2.93 and higher.
