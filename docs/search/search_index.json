Margin \uf0c1 Set space between Islands for Pack Islands operation. Tip It\u2019s important to have enough space (Margin) between UV Islands to avoid visual artefacts connected with texture filtering in game engine renders. Here are suggested Margin values to use for different size textures: 256 - 2px 512 - 4px 1024 - 8px 2048 - 16px 4096 - 32px 8192 - 64px UV Coverage \uf0c1 Calculate Islands UV Coverage for active UV map. Increasing UV Coverage value leads to the increasing Texel Density value, this in turn leads to the more efficient UV space usage and you can see more pixels on your model using the same texture. Tip To increase UV Coverage value and achieve efficient UV space usage (80-90% of UV Coverage): Cut big Islands into smaller pieces if you have too much empty space. Upscale small objects on UV map to fill empty space. Downscale UV Islands that are barely visible on the model (e.g. bottom, back parts, etc.). Use UVPackmaster Pack Engine with enabled Heuristic option. Pack Engine \uf0c1 Panel Supported Pack Engines \uf0c1 Zen UV supports three Pack engines: Blender Pack UV Packmaster 2, 3 UV Packer Pack Engine Preferences \uf0c1 The main preferences of each Pack Engine are placed in Zen UV interface. To use all the preferences please go to the main interface of the engine (UV Packer, UV Packmaster). Below we described General preferences for all Pack Engines. If you want to obtain information about Specific preferences for some engine, please refer to the documentation of the corresponding engine. Texture Size \uf0c1 Texture Size preset, works in pair with Margin . Average Islands Scale \uf0c1 Average Islands Scale before Pack Islands operation. Rotate Islands \uf0c1 Allow Pack Engine rotate Islands. Tip UV Packmaster Pack Engine has super useful option Lock Overlapping. It\u2019s recommended to be used to Pack Stacked and Overlapping Islands. If you don\u2019t have UV Packmaster installed, but still want to Pack Stacked and Overlapping Islands watch this video . Tip If you want to use specific UV Packmaster Pack Engine features that are not present in Zen UV interface do not forget to transfer existing settings using this Transfer settings button. Then you can open UV Packmaster interface and complete the setup.","title":"Pack"},{"location":"pack/#pack","text":"Panel","title":"Pack"},{"location":"pack/#pack-islands","text":"Pack all Islands using selected Pack Engine .","title":"Pack Islands"},{"location":"pack/#margin","text":"Set space between Islands for Pack Islands operation.

Uses three algorithms. Zen Relax - The algorithm is most suitable for organic objects. Angle Based - Blender\u2019s native algorithm. Most suitable for the hard surfaces objects. Conformal - Blender\u2019s native algorithm. Same as Angle Based , but much faster. However, can lead to undesired results if the island is complicated. World Orient. \uf0c1 Rotate Islands the way they are oriented on the Models. Each method (Organic/Hard Surface) uses a heuristic approach and correctly orients most of the Islands in its area. Method: Hard Surface / Organic - The orientation method is suitable for geometry types. Further orient - Additional turn. Allows you to turn the island to a horizontal or vertical if the island is located at an angle in the model. Flip By Axis - Allow changing direction of the island after basic orientation. Suitable if needed change orientation from legs to head for example. Randomize. \uf0c1 Randomize the position, rotation, and scale of the islands or selected vertices. Quadrify Islands \uf0c1 Straighten rectangular-shaped Islands. Preferences By selected Edges - Selected Edges will be used and marked as Seams during Quadrify Islands operation. Works only in edge selection mode. Mark Borders - Mark borders as seams/sharp after Quadrify Island operation. Mark Seams - Mark seam in case Mark Borders is on. Mark Sharp - Mark sharp in case Mark Borders is on. Orient to: - How to orient Quadrified Islands. Initial - Leave orientation as is. Vertical - Set orientation vertical. Horizontal - Set orientation horizontal. Average Texel Density - Averaging the size for the processed islands. Pack Quadrified - Pack Islands after Quadrify Islands operation. Pin Quadrified - Pin Islands after Quadrify Islands operation. Tip Tag Quadrified Islands as Finished to preserve them from unwrapping. It\u2019s recommended to Tag as Finished all manually changed Islands. Reshape Island \uf0c1 Changes the island\u2019s shape depending on the preset. Here is full information about Reshape Island. Selected - Straighten the selected Edge Loops and relax not selected vertices. U Direction / V Direction - Edges is aligned in the indicated direction. Borders - Straighten the edges of the island in even lines according to the given parameters.
